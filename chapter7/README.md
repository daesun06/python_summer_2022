Chapter 7:
    What you'll learn:
    - Make code more reusable using functions.
    - Organize and group code into functions.
    - Define functions in Python using the 'def' keyword.
    - Call your own functions from programs that you write.
    - Define and us functions that accept parameters as input values.
    - Write functions that return values when called.
    - Convert a mathemetical formula to code as a function that returns the function's value.
    - Explain some features of event-driven programs.
    - Write a simple event-driven app that uses event listener / event handler.
    - Write an app that acceps mouse clicks and draws.
    - Code event handlers for keyboard events.
    - Program event handler functions that take parameters
    - Use x- and y-coordinates on the screen to draw in specific patterns.

    We define a function, or reusable code using the 'def' keyword (Short for 'define')
        def function_name():
            # code grouped by indents 

    We call or run the function's code using the function's name followed by parentheses.
        function_name()

    We can pass values into functions, putting parameters inside the parentheses.

    When we specifie a function, we tell it what arguments to expect
        def function_name(paremeters):
            # code that uses the parameters

    When we call that function, we pass the arguments into the function's parentheses.
        function_name(arguments)
