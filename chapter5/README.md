Chapter 5:
    What you'll learn
    - Use 'if' statements to make decisions using conditionals.
    - Use conditionals and Boolean expressions to control program flow.
    - Describe how a Boolean expression evaluates to 'True' of 'False'.
    - Write condiotional expressions using comparison operators (<, >, ==, !=, <=, >=).
    - Use if-else statement combinations to choose between two alternative program paths.
    - Test a variable to see if it is odd or even using the modulo operator, %.
    - Write if-elif-else statements that select from among a number of options.
    - Use 'and' and 'or' to test multiple conditions at once. 
    - Use the 'not' operator to check whether a value or variable is 'False'.
    - Explain how letters and other characters are stored as numeric values in computers.
    - Use 'ord()' and 'chr()' to convert characters into their ASCII equivalents and vice versa.
    - Manipulate strings using various string functions like 'lower()', 'upper()', and 'isupper()'.
    - Add strings and characters together using the + operator.

    The 'if' statement allows us o tell the computer 'whether' to run a set of statements based on a condition.
        if (condition):
            (indented statement(s))

    Boolean expressions allow programs to make decisions based on a condition.

    Conditional expressions evaluate to 'True' or 'False'
